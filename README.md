# Car Parking Management System

This Project is a car parking management application developed using C++. It uses basic concepts of OOPs and file handling.

## Appendix

This project uses file handling to store all the user entered data into the two database files
Database files : </br>
carparkdb.txt : This file stores all the information of the car and other data entered by the user. </br>
1. carparkexpensedb.txt : This file contains the expenses accumulated for the car in the time being. </br>
